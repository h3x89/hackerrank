# You are given an array of n integers, where n ranges from 2 to 200, inclusive. The elements in the array range from -200 to 200, inclusive. Your task is to return an array in which each element is the sum of a pair composed of an element and its 'opposite' element.

# By 'opposite', we mean that in an array of n elements, the first and last elements are paired, the second and second-to-last elements are paired, and so on. If the array is of odd length, the middle element pairs with itself.

# The function should handle both positive and negative integers and be capable of dealing with an odd number of elements in the list.

# For example, given an input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], your function should return [6, 6, 6]. This is because the first element 1 plus the last element 5 equals 6, the second element 2 plus the second-to-last element 4 equals 6, and the middle element 3 plus itself equals 6.

def solution(numbers):
    n = len(numbers)
    result = []
    # Iterate over half of the array
    for i in range(n // 2):
        # Add the sum of the current element and its opposite
        result.append(numbers[i] + numbers[n - i - 1])
    # If the array has an odd length, add the middle element twice
    if n % 2 == 1:
        # Add the middle element twice
        result.append(numbers[n // 2] * 2)
    return result

print(solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
